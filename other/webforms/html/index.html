<h1>Welcome to the Server Orphanage</h1>

Here you can claim ownership of a server or give yourself (and others) shared custody of servers (multiple owners).
If you are not a server owner but a user, you may also register yourself as such.

The difference between a server owner and a user is the type of emails you might get. (see table below)

<table>
<tr><th></th><th>owner</th><th>user</th></tr>
<tr><td>downtime notification</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td></tr>
<tr><td>questions - maintenance contract</td><td>yes</td><td>no</td></tr>
<tr><td>questions - backup related</td><td>yes</td><td>no</td></tr>
